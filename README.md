# Particle Falls

### Description:
A programm that given a static image of a waterfall automatically detects a waterfall based on pixel coloring and creates a rectangle around 
it. Within this rectangle it creates particles to emulate the flowing of the water down the waterfall. The color hereby is approximated
to create an as real looking image as possible.
